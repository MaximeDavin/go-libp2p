# Components

## Transport

```go
    type Transport interface{
        Dial(p peer.ID) Conn
        Listen() Listener
    }
```

## Network

```go
    type Network struct {
        conns       map[peer.ID][]*Conn
        listeners   map[Listener]struct{}
        transports  map[int]Transport
        muxers

    }

    func (n *netowrk) Connect(p peer.ID) Conn {
        if p in conns and conns[p].isUsable:
            return conns[p]
        else:
            conn = transport.Dial(p) // If we have quic + tcp which one should we use ?
            conns[p] = conn
            return conn
    }


```

## Host

```go
    type Host struct {
        network Network
        mux     Mux
        peerstore Peerstore
    }

    type HostI interface {

    }
```

# Workflow

## Build

1. Entrypoint `libp2p.New(opts ...Option)` is called in Prysm when a new Service is started. The returned object is stored in Service.Host. Options are store in a Config object.
2. `cfg.NewNode()` is called to build the host with the Config. Acts like a main function that build all services needed:

3. create a new Network/Swarm `n = newNetwork()`
4. create a new BasicHost `n.h = newHost(n)`
5. add transports to Network `for t in transport do n.addTransport(t)`. An upgrader is added to the transport object to add security (eg Noise) and stream multiplexing (mplex or yamux) when a new connection will be established.
6. start
